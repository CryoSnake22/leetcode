# Why this repo ?

This is not an attempt to inflate my github profile (althought those green squares do look nice).
I simply find it neat to have a local copy of all my solutions and to be able to visualize my activity history
in a centralized way.

This is also a way I'm getting myself used to using git in everyday projects.
